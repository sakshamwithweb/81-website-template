                <h1>Early Life</h1>
Obafemi Awolowo was born in Ikenné, Western State, 
Nigeria, on March 6, 1909. He received his early education in the mission schools of Ikenné,
 Abeokuta, and Ibadan. Often he worked at odd jobs to raise money for tuition fees, and his 
 entrepreneurial spirit continued to express itself in the various careers which he subsequently 
 sampled: journalist, teacher, clerk, moneylender, taxidriver, produce broker. His organizational and
  political inclinations became evident as he moved to high-level positions in the Nigerian Motor Transport Union, 
  the Nigerian Produce Traders' Association, the Trades Union Congress of Nigeria, and the Nigerian Youth Movement,
   of which he became Western Provincial secretary.

<h1>Education</h1>
Despite his interest in business ventures, Awolowo wanted to continue his formal education. 
In 1944 he completed a University of London correspondence course for the bachelor of commerce degree. His greatest ambition,
 however, was to study law, which he undertook in London from 1944 to 1946, when he was called to the bar. Returning to 
 Nigeria in 1947, he developed a thriving practice as a barrister in Ibadan.

During his residence in London, Awolowo moved to a position of prominence in the struggle for Nigerian independence.
 In 1945 he wrote his first book, Path to Nigerian Freedom, in which he was highly critical of British policies of
  indirect administration and called for rapid moves toward self-government and Africanization of administrative
   posts in Nigeria. He also expressed his belief that federalism was the form of government best suited to the 
   diverse populations of Nigeria, a position to which he consistently adhered. Also in 1945 in London, he helped
    found the Egbe Omo Oduduwa (Society of the Descendants of Oduduwa, the mythical ancestor of the Yoruba-speaking 
    peoples), an organization devoted to the study and preservation of Yoruba culture.

<h1>Politics</h1>
In 1950 Awolowo founded and organized the Action Group political party in Western Nigeria to participate in the 
Western Regional elections of 1951. The Action Group's platform called for immediate termination of British rule 
in Nigeria and for development of various public welfare programs, including universal primary education, increase 
of health services in rural areas, diversification of the Western Regional economy, and democratization of local 
governments. The Action Group won a majority, and in 1952 Awolowo as president of the Action Group became leader 
of the party in power in Western Nigeria. In 1954 he became the first premier of the Western Region, on which
 occasion he was awarded an honorary chieftaincy. During his tenure as leader and premier, he held the regional
  ministerial portfolios of local government, finance, and economic planning. He was also chairman of the Regional 
  Economic Planning Commission.

In 1963 Awolowo was found guilty of conspiring to overthrow the government of Nigeria and was sentenced to ten years
 of imprisonment. In 1966, however, an attempted coup d'etat led to the suspension of the Nigerian federal constitution
  and the empowerment of a military government which promised a new constitution. That year, while in prison, Awolowo 
  wrote Thoughts on the Nigerian Constitution, in which he argued for the retention of a federal form of government
   composed of 18 states. Later, in 1966, he was released from prison and the following year was invited to join the 
   Federal Military Government as federal commissioner of finance and as vice chairman of the Federal Executive Council.

In 1968 Awolowo published his fourth book, The People's Republic, calling for federalism, democracy, and socialism 
as the necessary elements in a new constitution which would lead to the development of a stable and prosperous Nigeria.
 Although he praised the Federal Military Government for creating a 12-state federal system in 1967, he predicted further 
 political difficulties because these states had not been based on ethnic and linguistic affinities.

Awolowo continued to serve the government as commisioner of finance and vice chairman of the Federal Executive Council
 throughout the years of Nigeria's civil war with Biafra (1967-1970). In his 1970 book, The Strategy and Tactics of the 
 People"s Republic of Nigeria, he implied a position which he would state more firmly in subsequent years: that the
  government's post-war spending should be devoted to development rather than to the military. He resigned in 1971 
  to protest the government's continuation of military rule, and in 1975, following the overthrow of the Gowon government,
   issued a press release questioning the country's military spending. In 1979 and 1983 he ran for president as the candidate 
   for the Unity Party of Nigeria, losing to Shehu Shagari. Awolowo returned to private life upon the overthrow of the Shagari
    government in December 1983. He died in Ikenné on May 9, 1987.
